WCL uses some libraries that don't ship with it to export and import.

To run the the work item exporter and importer

Download opencsv e.g. from http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencsv/files/opencsv/3.7/ 
Rename the jar file (e.g. opencsv-3.7.jar) to opencsv.jar and place the library into the folder 
lib in the WCL folder. Note, tests have been performed with OpenCSF 3.7

You can now use the script files to run WCL.

To run the workitem command line in Eclipse, add the jar files to the classpath e.g. as User Library.
